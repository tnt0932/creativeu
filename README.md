CreativeU
=========
CreativeU is a PHP/MySQL web platform for students to showcase snippets of their work.
Screenshots at bottom of readme.

_Note: This is an old student group project that was never really finished. Fork at your own risk :)_

### Installation:

1. Clone git repo

2. Create a 'creativeu' database

3. Import creativeu.sql into the creativeu database
_Note: It has been purged of most entries so it probably won't work right out of the box_

4. Copy db-template.php and rename to db-local.php and populate with db info
